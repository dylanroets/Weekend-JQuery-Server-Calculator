Dylan's Server Side Calculator

## Description

I solved the problem of creating a server side calculator while having all the logic on the server.

I used ajax to send all inputs and button presses over to the server, there the server did it's calculations with a switch statement and then I balled up the data in an object to send back.

That ball of logic was sent back to the client.js and from there it was all parsed out and appended to the DOM. I also did some minimal CSS to beautify the webpage!
